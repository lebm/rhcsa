# RHCSA

## My notes for RHCSA certification

On this project my main goal is to prepare myself for  RHCSA certification. I will put here any document, notes, tips that I find useful for the certification. But I have also secondary goals: learn how to use git, github, Markdown and the Atom editor. I will try to write all these materials on Atom, using Markdown,  and of course I will control its versions with git on github.

Feel free to use these docs anyway you like as long as you agree with to LICENSE.

Corrections and suggestions are welcome.
